MagicMIME
=======
Originally By Paul Connel, (http://www.paulconnell.info/) I've taken Control and Maintenance of this RiaForge Project.

MagicMIME works Similar to how Linux/Unix check the contents of a file to determine their type, instead of using the file extension, this CF function performs a similar task.

Simple CFFUNCTION that returns a structure detailing the filetype/mimetype etc.

Currently supports:-

Adobe PDF Document
Microsoft Office Open XML Format Document
Microsoft Office Open XML Format Spreadsheet
Microsoft Office Open XML Format Presentation
Microsoft Office Word 97-2003 Document
Microsoft Office Excel 97-2003 Document
Microsoft Office Powerpoint 97-2003 Document
Graphics interchange format Image
Portable Network Graphics Image
JPEG Image
HTML (Experimental)

Tested and built in CF8 - will probably run in CFMX7 and CF9.
